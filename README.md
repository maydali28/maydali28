### Hi there 👋


I'm Mohamed Ali, a Senior Backend & Platform Engineer with over **7 years of experience** building cloud-native systems that scale reliably in production.

I specialize in backend and platform engineering, working on systems where performance, reliability, and long-term maintainability matter. I’ve delivered solutions across enterprise and startup environments, improving delivery speed, observability, and operational confidence.

#### 💻 What I do

I help teams design, build, and operate backend systems by focusing on:

- Designing clean, scalable APIs and service boundaries  
- Building cloud-native backend services and microservices  
- Architecting secure, production-ready platforms  
- Automating CI/CD pipelines for predictable releases  
- Improving system observability, performance, and reliability  

I’m comfortable owning systems end-to-end, from architecture and implementation to deployment and production support.
