## Hi, I’m Mohamed Ali 👋

![My GitHub Game](game.gif)

I’m a **Senior Backend & Cloud Engineer** with over 7 years of experience building and operating cloud-native backend systems.

My work focuses on backend services written primarily in **Java and Spring Boot**, running on **Kubernetes** in cloud and hybrid environments. I spend most of my time working on systems that have grown complex over time, where safe evolution, operational clarity, and predictable delivery are more important than quick fixes.

Alongside backend development, I take responsibility for the platform foundations that make systems reliable in practice — **CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, deployment workflows, and observability**. This allows teams to ship changes with confidence and understand how their systems behave in production.

I care strongly about **long-term ownership**. I work closely with engineers and technical leaders to simplify architectures, modernize services step by step, and establish practices that continue to work as systems grow and teams change.

### 💻 What I work on
- Backend services and APIs built with Java and Spring Boot  
- Cloud-native systems running on Kubernetes  
- CI/CD automation and infrastructure as code  
- Observability and operational tooling for production systems  
- Long-lived platforms used by multiple teams over time  

### 🛠️ Technologies
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, GraphQL  
- **Cloud & Platform**: Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, Terraform, CI/CD  
- **Data & Messaging**: PostgreSQL, search and messaging systems  
- **Observability**: Monitoring, dashboards, and production diagnostics  

📍 Based in Tunis, Tunisia  
🌍 Open to remote and relocation opportunities
